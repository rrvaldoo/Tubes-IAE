# DosWallet - Web (Vite)

This is a small web-optimized version of the DosWallet app created with Vite + React.

Quick start:

1. cd frontend-web
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The app connects to backend GraphQL services at http://localhost:5001/graphql and http://localhost:5002/graphql. Make sure Docker services are running (see project root docker-compose).
